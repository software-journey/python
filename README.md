# Like LEGO? Love Python! 🧱🐍

Welcome to the official code repository for the “Like LEGO? Love Python!” article series! If you’ve ever stepped on a LEGO brick at 3 AM and thought “this pain could teach me object-oriented programming,” you’re in the right place.

## 🎯 What’s This About?

This repository contains all the source code, examples, and LEGO-themed Python adventures from the article series published on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/the-software-s-journey). Each episode breaks down Python concepts using the universal language of plastic building blocks - because if you can build a LEGO Death Star, you can definitely build a Python class.

## 📚 Episodes

### Episode 1: Building Your First Brick (Defining Classes)

**[📖 Read the article](https://dev.to/the-software-s-journey/like-lego-love-python-2104)** | **[💻 Source code](./episode-01/)**

Learn how Python classes are basically LEGO instruction manuals that you get to write yourself. Discover the mysteries of `__init__()`, befriend the enigmatic `self`, and create your first LEGO brick in Python (without the risk of finding it with your bare foot later).

**What you’ll build:**

- A `LegoBrick` class with color, dimensions, and studs
- Methods to describe your bricks and check if they can connect
- Your first instances (actual bricks stamped from your blueprint)

**Key concepts covered:**

- Class definition (`class` keyword)
- The `__init__()` constructor method
- Instance attributes (`self.something`)
- Instance methods (behaviors your bricks can perform)
- Creating and using object instances

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher (because even LEGO has minimum age requirements)
- A sense of humor (optional but recommended)
- Willingness to see LEGO metaphors in everything (warning: may become permanent)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/software-journey/python.git

# Navigate to the repository
cd python

# Pick an episode and start playing!
cd episode-01
python lego_brick.py
```

### Running the Code

Each episode folder contains:

- 📄 Source code files (`.py`)
- 📝 Additional examples and exercises
- 🧪 Optional: tests (because even LEGO instructions sometimes have mistakes)

Simply navigate to any episode folder and run the Python files:

```bash
cd episode-01
python lego_brick.py
```

## 🎓 Learning Path

This series is designed for:

- **Beginners** who are new to object-oriented programming
- **LEGO enthusiasts** who accidentally stumbled into coding
- **Python developers** who want a refresher with extra plastic bricks
- **Anyone** who believes learning should involve at least 40% whimsy

### Recommended Learning Approach

1. **Read the article** on Dev.to (get the concepts with humor)
1. **Explore the code** in this repository (see it in action)
1. **Experiment** with the examples (break things, it’s digital LEGO!)
1. **Build something new** (combine concepts like you combine bricks)

## 🤝 Contributing

Found a bug in the code? Discovered a better LEGO metaphor? Have an idea for a future episode?

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to:

- 🐛 Report bugs (preferably brick-related puns)
- 💡 Suggest improvements
- 🎨 Add examples
- 📝 Fix typos (LEGO instructions are precise, our code should be too)

Just open an issue or submit a pull request. Be kind, be constructive, and when in doubt, ask yourself: “What would a LEGO Master Builder do?”

Just like LEGO bricks: free to remix, rebuild, and share. But please don’t actually try to patent the 2x4 brick - someone already tried that.

Remember: there are no stupid questions, only bricks we haven’t figured out how to connect yet.

## 🎯 What’s Next?

**Episode 2**: Inheritance - When Child Bricks Rebel Against Their Parent Classes

Learn how `class SpecializedBrick(LegoBrick)` lets you create fancy new bricks that inherit all the goodness of their parent class while adding their own special sauce. It’s like LEGO Technic: still LEGO, but with gears and motors and an instruction manual that makes you question your life choices.

**Built with ❤️ and an unreasonable number of LEGO metaphors**

*P.S. - No LEGO bricks were harmed in the making of this repository. The same cannot be said for the developer’s feet.*
